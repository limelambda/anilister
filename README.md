I sincerely hope that no one uses such a dumb format as me with a four point excimation point scale? But it's pretty simple to use
1. Make a `env.json` similar to this with your own [api clients](https://anilist.co/settings/developer) id and secret
```
{
    "client_id": 30459,
    "client_secret": "oSEcR3TfYOurDEve1Op3ERAPp7or5wHA7e4VeRfR"
}
```
2. Run `nametoid.py`
3. Check anime.json for `"anilist_id": null,` and make sure you spelled them properly in `anime.txt` and either update it manually or rerun `nametoid.py` on your updated `anime.txt`
4. Run and follow directions from `updateprofile.py`
5. Check your account beacuse Jojo is actually Hello Again JoJo and Frieren is actually Sousou no Frieren: ●● no Mahou
